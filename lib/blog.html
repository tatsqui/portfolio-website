          <h2>Tid Bits:</h2>
          <p>
            <span class="drop">S</span>unday April 7th. 
            The past two months in Seattle has been a WILD journey for me. It actually will be two months exactly on April 15th. I arrived in the PNW 
            about three weeks before Ada was scheduled to start. I have had some pretty big moves in the past but this one definitely tops them all. 
            I was nervous when I moved to Puerto Rico for a year, but the internship I did guaranteed me a place to live even though I had to house hunt, 
            which was stressful. And since 2011, I have basically had a pretty good idea of where the next place I was going to live would be before I 
            moved. But Seattle was a new experience for me in that I had to move here without any idea of where I would live. I was totally dependent on 
            the open hearts and free couches of my one friend who lives in Portland. There were definitely some very nice people at Ada in my cohort who 
            offered to put me up while I house-searched, which was so appreciated.

            Learning to code has been one of the, if not the most, challenging intellectual experiences of my life. I've done an immersive program in the 
            past for Outdoor Leadership, but this one is different. It's a lot harder to see the light at the end of the tunnel because there is just SO 
            MUCH TO LEARN! It will be a constant journey of learning, applying, adapting, and learning all over again since technology moves and grows so 
            rapidly. Once you think you've done something well, a new tool, a new approach, a new framework comes out to make the process even better. I 
            really like the growth mindset of the tech sector, and it feels like I have found a career where being a hard worker, and being driven to do 
            the best you can at all times is highly rewarded. Learning at Ada has also been a wonderful experience because it truly is a supportive learning
            environment. The emphasis is on practice, and mastery and not on scores or competition. It's really hard to believe, due to the toxic
            capitalist and masculinist society that we are all raised in, that this is true - but it is! Every day, even when I get down on myself or have a 
            bout of anxiety that I am not "good enough" - I remember how LUCKY I am to have gotten here - that the folks at Ada believed in me, and still do, 
            and that I am enough. I constantly surprise myself at how much I can learn at such a fast pace. I definitely don't feel like a whiz kid, but I do
            sincerely believe that I can learn whatever I put my mind towards, and that I will be successful. I will land the coding interview and I will be a 
            bad ass graduate of Ada Developers Academy and I will be a full stack software developer with a JOB very very soon!
